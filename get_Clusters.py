Executive Summary
This dissertation aimed to examine the topic “The external environment in China and its effect on foreign beverage companies: A case Study of Pepsi and Coca Cola”. The literature review of this dissertation concerns theoretical aspects of Environmental Effect on the Strategic Choice, Chinese Policy towards Multinationals, FDI Motivation, Chinese Political and Cultural Influence on PepsiCo & Coca-Cola, influence of Chinese Culture and Politics, and Performance of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in China. On the other hand, the key purpose of the methodology chapter is to demonstrate the research method, data collection process, limitations of the study, questionnaire design, and data analysis process. However, the author of this dissertation will design a questionnaire in order to find out the positive and negative side of the external environment in China for Pepsi and Coca Cola. This dissertation also concentrates on primary research to observe cultural and political factors for the operation of these two companies.

Problem Statement
Introduction
This dissertation critically illustrates the perceptions and attitudes of the external environment in China and factors touching their motivation and exploration within the foreign beverage companies where the Multinational beverage companies PepsiCo and Coca Cola have been assessed. The dissertation has been organised and contained the five major episodes designed below-

Problem Statement: This chapter of the dissertation has organised with a study in wide-ranging among the selected organisations, endowing with the underlying problems of the external environment in China, hypothetical principles of strategic choice and agendas for the research; raises the research questions and affirms the limitations and scope of the study used within this present dissertation.
Literature Review: This part of the dissertation launches with a chronological indication of external environment in China and its motivation theories; then, recites too more up-to-date literature integrating the strategies of Multinational Corporations with the aim to theoretically answering and arguing to the research questions. In addition, this part also focuses on accomplishment of the conceptual framework of regularity authority in China and MNCs to ensure a suitable external environment to sustain investors’ confidence like PepsiCo and Coca Cola in China.
Research Methodology: This episode of this dissertation delivers the justification and plans the way out on how the research would be conducted, describes position and sample population selection, data assembly and treatment, develops a qualitative analysis of the data, gives description of the process, and states limitations to conducting this study;
Findings & Discussion: This segment of the dissertation specifies the collected data, denotes unexpected results by concreting on the findings as well as hypothetical uses for the information delivered from the external environment in China for PepsiCo and Coca Cola and proposes idea generation for the research from primary and secondary data; enlightens the results in reflecting the outcomes of the research and discusses the validation of findings;
Conclusion: This final episode of the dissertation summaries the process, advises sensible outcomes that construct the key recommendations and promotes conclusions as well as implications of this study towards the effect of the external environment in China on foreign beverage companies such as PepsiCo and Coca Cola.

Background of the problem
Yallapragada et al (2005) has approached that the external environment for modern business communities concerning China’s politics and culture has been inherited from the Cultural Revolution commenced in 1966 led by Mao Tse Tung based on Marxist philosophy. The political economy of China has including people’s culture, beliefs, and faith has come out from idealism towards materialism, individual ownership of property and land had replaced with collective ownership of the society, and the people were loyal to the rigid, centrally controlled communist party’s regime, and in this period the world’s largest population has kept apart foreign investors.

Yallapragada et al (2005) also added the ill experience of PepsiCo and mentioned that it has invested more than US$ 500 million from its journey to China in 1998 to 2005 but, cannot see the face of profit due to non-cooperative joint venture partner and lack of transparency as well as legal barriers. The struggle of PepsiCo in China has faced the Chinese entry to the WTO for major reformation.

Tse (2010) mentioned that in 2008, while Coca Cola placed its offer to purchase Huiyuan Juice, the largest domestic producer of soft drinks, the Ministry of Commerce showing the reason that it would conflict with Chinese anti-monopoly law neglected the bid. To sustain with the challenge of China market, Coca-Cola has needed to put together its upstream functions with R&D and product innovation, to build marketing platforms emphasizing on local consumers needs with ‘one world’ based global strategy.

Alon et al (2009) demonstrated that at the very beginning, due to cultural constraints Coca Cola has suffered linguistic differences between Chinese and English and it was very difficult to identify appropriate pronunciation of the brand name and stand as a major dilemma to localization of the brand name. To overcome this dilemma, Coca Cola conducted long study and after huge spending Coca Cola utilized alternative brand approaches including brand meaning and feeling extension and dual adoptions (Alon et al 2009).

Wu (2008) conducted extensive research with the external environment of China for multinationals and argued that the organizations with their internal resources and capabilities turned the external environment into ‘a bundle of resources’ though the external environment including politics and culture has long been kept an adverse effect on the growth of multinational during the communist era. In such a background, the problem of external environment in China including its politics and culture, China’s entrance to the WTO may facilitate MNCs with new legislation to cope with the Chinese environment.

Rationale for the research
Many scholars tried to find out the solution to the question of how the environment of China could influence the foreign investors and MNC’s operation in the domestic market to raise their market share and to what extent the Chinese environment cooperates the foreign companies to sustain their stability and investors confidence from last era. Most of the contemporary researchers have concentrated on the FDI flow, corporate governance and regulatory reform in the market, but an overarching research agenda has not been proposed yet on whether the external environment in China has a conscious drive and direct effect on the foreign beverage companies. Kao and Mao (2009) argued that the wide-ranging and effectual analysis of the external environment would facilitate the management for enhanced planning and dynamic decision-making capabilities to respond to the changing environment with successful strategies.

Wai (2010) explored that the foreign companies in China have been facing inauspicious external environment and the leadership of China is under severe constraints and to improve the situation government is taking different reformation initiatives, at the same time China with adverse external environment seeks to set up a new global political economy that replicates China’s ideas and visions.

The rationale of this research is to analyze the external environment in China experienced by observing the real scenario of PepsiCo and Coca Cola, and to evaluate to what extent the external environment in China is effective to retain foreign beverage companies and facilitate to increase their market share. In addition, the case of PepsiCo and Coca Cola has escalated the awareness of managers to take control over the external environment in China with their internal resources and capabilities to utilize competitive advantages in China, this dissertation will assist the academia, regulators, and investors with better understanding about the external environment in China including politics and culture factors. Through this investigation, the mentioned companies will get a potential investment environment in the Chinese domestic market and get a better level of investor’s confidence, which will provide the companies a practical advantage over their managers.

Research Question and Objectives
This dissertation aimed to investigate how the external environment, with specific focus on political and cultural factors, has affected the strategic choices and performances of PepsiCo and Coca Cola in China? To structure the aim, the dissertation has been designed to respond to the following research questions, the answer to this question would enable the legislators and regulating authority to organize the policy and towards a greater motivation for increased confidence of foreign investors, while the foreign beverage companies will get a better understanding to design their strategies in China. Three research objectives are listed below:

- How the theoretical framework of external environment effects on the strategic choice of modern business?
- What is the motivation of Chinese Policy towards the Multinationals?
- How Chinese politics and culture influence the strategic choices and performances of PepsiCo and Coca Cola in China?

All of these above issues will assess under certain considerations along with the theoretical background and these tasks are significant since each of those issues are closely interrelated with the scenario of the proposed companies PepsiCo and Coca Cola and their performance under the external environment in China.

Limitations of the project
The researcher has suffered following problems to formulate this paper:

- Lack of reliable secondary data sources or unnecessary information was the main problem to organize the paper, for instance, relevant data on PepsiCo and Coca Cola is not available on the internet;
- In addition, the author got very short time for planning and conducting research;
- It was not possible to collect data from the executives or top management of PepsiCo and Coca Cola. As a result, the researcher would complete the paper based on secondary sources to overcome this dilemma;
- Budget was not sufficient to purchase relevant reports or journal articles and field survey.

Scopes of the study:

The author has selected an exceptional topic, which gives the chance to research on various issues, for example, the external environment in China and its effect on foreign beverage companies;
One of the main objectives of this dissertation is to evaluate the impact of external environment in China on the multinational companies;
The researcher has scope to find out the difference between PepsiCo and Coca Cola case;
As the issue of external environment in China interrelated with political and cultural influence, the endeavor of the researcher to fill in the gap or loophole of the outcomes of previous research;
On the other hand, many large MNCs have suffered from the ineffective and adverse external environment in China, in this context; the researcher has scopes to give proper guidance to reduce unfavorable effects of external environment in China.

Relevant Literature Review
Environmental Effect on the Strategic Choice
Zhang (2008) argued that the atmosphere of the strategy and the strategic supervision in the strategic environment and its breakdown has played a major role during the formulation and execution of the business strategies in both domestic and international markets. Moreover, it is obligatory to make trade-offs between the firm’s internal resources and peripheral atmosphere for their impending strategies. Alternatively, business organizations would construct strategic success proportionately if their strategic dynamics have been relatively consistent with the transformation of both the interior and exterior atmosphere. Additionally, ecological breakdown of the business organization has formed through scrutinizing appraisal and finally, by weighing up the gathered information, which is constructed from several ecological sources. On the other hand, firm’s operational tasks have outlined through a three-phase hierarchy where macro and micro environmental dynamics as well as unambiguous forces of an organization are examined through proper manner.

The most elaborated form is the microenvironment where political stability, societal policies, legal affairs, cultural behavior, and the improvement of technology are scrutinized and as a result, potential prospects along with the hazards could be predicted. Second phase microenvironment has principally focused on four issues which have included industry structures, rivalry movements, consumers' needs and demand, and the supply chain management. In another term, an organization has examined and strengthened its individual resources as well as its limitations. Thus, an organization has elegantly gone through both friendly and hostile atmospheres. In following diagram, an elaborated form of strategic environmental analysis is plotted where every step of the environmental analysis is successively offered (Zhang, 2008).

Economic factors: Several sub- elements of this environment are GNP or GDP per capita, inflation and unemployment rate, economic growth, rate of currency exchange, balance of trade and payment, trading partners, rate of exchange etc.
Socio- cultural forces: These incorporate different demographic variables, personal attitude, cultural structure etc. (PDO, 2009).
Technological forces: Here, the sub- elements are productivity, sophisticated production method, any sort of new technology, which can affect corporate performance, easy access, and expenditure of technological orientation etc.
Legal and Political Structure
Zhang (2008) added that in case of international business operation politics, legislation affairs have a great deal of influence on the organisation’s decision-making procedure, functional and operational areas, and on effectiveness and efficiencies. The key objective of the political and legal affair consideration of the target market’s political steadiness is to defend the unforeseen situations and occurrences in the target market’s location. Effects of the unforeseen situations have large depressing effect on organisation’s business activities. For instance, durable conflicts, strike of the root-level employees, violent threats, etc are the unforeseen situations.

On the other hand, business firms need to analyze business and commercial acts of the government, legitimacies of the tax payment, privatization policies, and labour laws, legal documents with the MNCs, regional trade affairs, and consumer rights. Among these legitimacies, there are significant roles of the MNCs policies. Additionally, commitments of the WTO (World Trade Organization) members and instruction of the IMF (International Monetary Fund) are also considerably noticed in this section. Finally, mission and goal of the commercial and business legislations instruct a business organisation to look after their business operational areas to stay free from the unforeseen situations and uphold continuing social and consumer responsibilities as well. (Zhang 2008)

Economic Policies
Datta (2005) stated that the economic policies of a country have covered following areas and other than these indicators, there are several significant regions, which have also equal involvement during formation of country’s economic policies. Additionally, these economic dynamics are also indispensable for the continuation of business operation in both home and abroad.

Economic growth: it determines whether a country would be treated as developed, emerging, and developing or under developed;
Inflation: high inflation rate resists prosperous economic development
Monetary and fiscal policies: Monetary and fiscal policies are modes of foreign exchange rates, foreign reserves, stability of the commodity prices, employment ratios and most importantly gold reserve of a country,

Chinese Policy towards the Multinationals
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the inhabitant of socialist economy, and it turned into the ‘raising tiger’ of global economy whilst under the full control of communist party. The Politburo of the Communist Party is the supreme authority that has driven to the market economy and welcomed foreign investment from seventies with strong reservation and control of the party upholding the national interest.

Kroeber (2006) pointed out that the economic growth model of China has integrated the objectives of the traditional open economic development viewpoints though the policy makers are rigorously controlled by socialist political economy due to the complete monopoly of Communist Party at the stare power. As a result, the extent that is necessary for quick raise of open economy to bring massive reformation has been delayed in the name of political stability, the esteem openness for the MNCs has not been allowed for investment and trade, but due to emerging economy, MNCs are eager to take entry in Chinese market and straggling for reformation.

The Chinese policy respond to the MNCs is to check and balance among the high FDI flow, huge offshore manufacturing, education and technological development and the low cost human resource while the MNCs is eager for reformation towards an open economy and uncontrolled local market and exercise to influence at the policy level.

FDI Motivation
Ford et al (2010) pointed out that the development literature of China has been deeply concerned with the relationship among extensive stage of FDI and economic growth though it has not been determined the interdependence of FDI and GDP growth due to there are some influential factors those deliberately kept positive role for proper use of FDI for national prospect. The endogenous growth theory pointed those influential factors as household capital stock, skilled human resource, innovative technology, openness, and slow, but sure liberalisation of the economy has ensured the FDI flow to utilise in productive means though FDI has significantly direct influence on creating employment opportunity.

At the beginning of 1980s, China has achieved enormous success in utilising foreign investments throughout manner of FDI. Consequence of this employment, their economic growth has boosted up massively and as well besides FDI, MNCs has significantly donated key role in the advancement of Chinese economy. From the beginning of 1990s to mid 1990s China has titled as the second leading FDI country in the world (State Statistical Bureau 1997), for instance, within 1996 China was employed $283.94 billion FDI invested by the famous MNCs. Due to the FDI graph has touched the boom point, now China has the most accelerating economic restructuring nation globally. Chinese open door strategies were the key motivation for entrance of the FDI remarkably and therefore utilise their largest inhabitants in terms of economical labour approach. Now after the end of 2003, China has established themselves as a gateway for both of FDI and MNCs (Zhang, 1998).

Conversely, the renowned MNCs like Intel, Microsoft, Coke, PepsiCo, McDonalds and so on in China has now treated as an intercontinental host to produce and promote their products and services globally. Additionally, MNCs market penetration as well as highlighting them both in the developed and developing countries China has opened several universities for the innovation and development of new technologies. Consequently, China has targeted their three imperative cities (Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong) to execute spacious market orientation, modern technology invention, and expert workforce development (Motohashi, 2005).

Objectives of MNCs & PRC
To widen economic growth China has mostly focused on durable economic forcefulness and it has earnestly employed its futuristic schemes. Thus, futuristic strategies of China have embraced ample scale of FDI, M and A of innovative skills, and joint ventures, franchising and licensing have cultivated, but to spirit up Chinese local industries, PRC has made available subsidiaries in terms of both discounted loans and interest free loans. Here, it has to be emphasized that PRC has always concentrated on common people’s living standard first through economic sovereignty, privileged tax payment and welcome entire entrepreneurial initiatives taken by the local industries and national defence.

Additionally, PRC has preferred to fortify their software industries by cut down tax payment, export privileges and hence PRC has estimated to earn RMB $10 billion during the current year. Besides the PRC, MNCs in China has also wished to proper behave with the open door policies in terms of employing young and skilled workforce though their key purpose to seek profit from China. For example, foreign IT firms (Microsoft Oracle, Google and Hewlett-Packard) have enjoyed several of unethical advantages to protect their intellectual properties by either legitimately or illegitimately. However, in several cases China has suffered from spoiled of their researchers’ proposals. Thus, in several cases Chinese vision to shore up their software industries and reduce unemployment ratios has held down by the MNCs. At last, it can be pointed that both the PRC and MNCs in China has still faced conflict over their strategic limitation or inflexibilities (Jackson, 2010).

Conflict among MNCs & PRC Government
According to the view of Blanchard (2007), within last 30-years MNCs over the world has boosted nine times compared to 1970s when there have only 7000 MNCs globally. At present, globally, there have in excess of 60,000 MNCs internationally whilst thousands of most famous MNCs have contributed on 80% international industries, but among them only 4.3% global GDP has resulted by only hundred leading MNCs. In case of China, from 2004–06 their number of MNCs has increased over 30,000 than previous period while this large number of MNCs has added an outstanding function in the economic escalation of China. Moreover, in China, MNCs has occupied more than twenty four million workers and 90 of the entire Chinese exporters have overlooked their several market segmentations as well as several industries like beverages. During this globalization era, MNCs has grasped immense power by utilising their huge returns, logistics, and supply chain management, brand image. Hence, MNCS in the international market have privileged to enjoy over local industries. All of these profit-oriented tasks have inspired to affect international government policies and ultimately generate inconsistency with the international administration.

The Microsoft case analysis in China has evaluated that all of the inconsistent matters arrived as an outcome of the “School of Thoughts” where JVs of the Microsoft in China has primarily occurred through an agreement of acquiring Microsoft’s software. On the other hand, Chinese administration has obliged the Microsoft to invest into their economy in terms of opening educational institute, training centre, and research organisation. Additionally, China has demand for discounted option during sale of PCs in China. Microsoft has denied this proposal and hence impact of the strategic “School of Thoughts” has assembled inconsistencies between these two parties (BruceHall & Biersteker, 2002).

Corporate Strategy & Chinese Economy
Chinese people have treated the term “strategy” as the behaviour of struggling whereas practice of business strategy has become rather modern in China. Hypothetically, corporate strategies have drafted entire guidelines in order to establish both stable and durable economic atmosphere. Corporate strategies of the Chinese MNCs have mostly concentrated on profit seeking by utilisation of the three-phase strategic formulation model. Following are the significant segment of Chinese economic development (Zhanming, 2001).

In eighties, Chinese administration has mostly governed through planned economic scheme and most of the SOEs have manufactured to contribute several target industries.
1990s the revolutionary period of Chinese economic system whilst practice of corporate strategies have started
From 2000 to present, practice of corporate strategies in broader form establishment of the market economy has significantly diverse from the planned economy.
An unusual practice of Chinese business holders has that they have implemented their strategies through precise form as well as awfully before entrance into the global economy. Contradictory issues of this policy has described in below.

According to the planned economy, there is no opportunity to make decisions since all of the authoritative power was in the state’s hand. More specifically, volume of production and sales was determined by the state.
Ambiguous property rights restricted organisation’s decision-making authority and still now Chinese government has nominated corporate leaders.
Conflict among turmoil planning with corporate strategies and hence, durable economic stability has restrained.
Chinese Political and Cultural Influence on PepsiCo & Coca-Cola
This part of the paper has concentrated on Chinese external environment components, which have significantly affected both strategy formulation and implementation of the MNCs (Multinational Companies). During entrance in China, international beverage companies like the PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have noticed two major aspects low cost over and above broader transition. Political and cultural factors of Chinese environment have disclosed several competitive assistances through which these two prominent beverage companies have economically formulate their strategies as well as perform better China. Some of them are- scope of economically employ of Chinese mediators, establishment of the brand name image, scope of establish JVs (Joint Ventures) as well as franchising with the local Chinese partners, supply of loyal and skilled workforce. Besides these advantages, CEO of the MNCs has kept durable pledge with Chinese market (Yang, 2007).

Influence of Chinese Culture and Politics
Lin (2000) 67% of the Chinese citizen has lived in rural areas with abundant new market potentiality. During discussion of the effect of Chinese culture, the term “Guanxi” came forward, which refers to “cordial trade-offs between family and societal members” since Chinese cultural and political atmosphere and social values have fabricated through collectivist bonding and socio-communist influence. These signs of culture and politics have shown the manner to understand consumer behaviour, entry and exit barriers of the market, marketing and selling strategies of an organisation (Lin, 2000).

At some point in characterization of Chinese cultural variation, China has enriched with 56 cultural components, 85,000 alphabetic characters, and 80 dialects in addition to greatly of diverging savours, whilst advertisement of new product and service in Chinese market, marketers be required to aware of these cultural dynamics. For instance, before entrance into the Chinese market, Coca-Cola studied on 40,000 characters to launch Coke as “Ke-kou-ke-la” which is most intimately a Chinese phonetic and literally, it is rendered as “happiness in the mouth” which is also the slogan of the Coke globally since its creation. Conversely, Chinese open door policy has assisted international beverage companies supply chain management, bo """

Performance of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in China
During entrance into foreign markets MNCs has studied on the internalization theory to appraise prospect of the new market and first of all, transportation cost as well. Coke has preferred China as their new entrance since 1979 because of high GDP growth around 9% and large number of population. Due to planned economy of China, Coke has mostly faced rationale behaviour to live their local industries. In time of entrance in China Coke has followed “fifty-fifty joint ventures” to launch their bottling plant operation. However, in that time they have no authoritative power to take managerial decision of the production and sale volume. Common behaviour of the MNCs has favoured WOSs (Wholly Owned Subsidiaries) during foreign market entrance.

However, Chinese economic system creates stress on the Coca-Cola and PepsiCo’s strategies in operating business function. Consequently, Coke has needed to choose franchising besides it existing joint venture partners. Overall business operation of the Coke in China has developed through three phases where entry-level has occurred from 1979 to 1984, secondly since rationale approach, from 1985 to 1992 they have lessen their bolting plants with the local partners and third, from 1993 to till now Coke has achieved several successes in China. They have merged with another two overseas bottling companies, gain minority share of 25% over and above authoritative power for decision making of the production and sales volume. It has to be pointed that due to rationale behave of Chinese administration until 1992 Coke has treated as beverage wholesaler in China. Considering other beverage brands Coke has seized 40% of Chinese carbonated market share in China whether PepsiCo has covered only 15% and for both of them it has to be included other beverage brands like Fanta, Sprite, and fruit juices (Mok, Dai & Yeung (2002).

Anti-Monopoly Law & Performance of Coke and PepsiCo
Chinese government has refused Coke’s US $2.3 billion offer to acquire their domestic beverage company Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. This issue has reflected the practice of anti-monopoly law by China to protect and prevent destructive M and A by the MNCs. Besides this issue, currently, Coke has operated 52.5% Chinese carbonated, soda and beverages drinks market where as the Pepsi has grasped 33%. Additionally, Coke has marketed both fruits and vegetable juice by 12% market share, but the Chinese domestic beverage company Huiyuan had only 8.5% market shares, and Chinese government has now operated 33% of domestic fruit and vegetable juice market segments (Lawrence, 2009).

Being most close rival of the Coke, Pepsi has noticed to invest large amount in China and their latest investment target has around US $2.5 billion for the next three years to establish several bottling plants and R and D (Research and Development) support to gain 26% profit margin. Current business figure of Pepsi in China has included 20,000 skilled workforces, more than 27 beverage brands over and above five farms (Forbes, 2010).

Besides large amount of investment in China both Coke and Pepsi has faced several complain of disobey labour laws as well as supply of bad foods (The China Daily, 2008). About 90% of local workers of Coke in China have brutally treated as temporary dispatched labour and as well forced to work 330 hours over a month with low wages though Coke has achieved 19% business growth in the first quarter of 2009 with an investment offer of US $2billion. The China Daily (2009) reported that both Coke and Pepsi have struggled to establish in Chinese beverage industry concentrated on around 800 million consumers (Xinhua, 2009).

Research Methodology
Introduction
The primary goal of this chapter is to express how the chosen research methodology will go with the prime goal of the dissertation inquiry and how it will complete throughout the current study.

Research Design
In order to originate the paper, the researcher would apply both exploratory and descriptive research approach. At this point, exploratory research would assist to originate a problem or explain it more precisely, develop theories, find out research questions, and determine priorities for further research, etc. On the other hand, descriptive research approach would assist to decide the perception of product or relevant groups and to illustrate market characteristics or functions by analyzing secondary data, surveys, panels, observational and other information. However, the researcher would concentrate on both qualitative and quantitative research approach to discuss on the external environment in China and its effect on foreign beverage companies.

Primary research
Bogdan & Biklen (1998), and Marshall & Rossman (1999) stated that primary data should gather for the specific motive or resolve the research dilemmas. Therefore, this study would consider this method in order to observe the actual cultural, legal, and political position of China for foreign beverage companies. To organise this paper, the researcher would consider four target groups to gather data from questionnaire. However, the following table shows more details about the target groups –

Group of Respondents	Number of respondents
Midlevel Management of Coca Cola	10
Midlevel Management of PepsiCo	10
Owner of Franchise or Retail outlets	10
Academia and Social Groups	10
Table 1: – Target Respondents for Survey. Source: Self generated.

Selection of Interview process
Yin (2003) and Skinner & Ivancevich (2003) stated that face-to-face interview is the most prominent system to collect data from target respondents. However, the researcher had not chosen this method considering short time limit, total number of respondents, and budget. In this circumstance, the researcher used more instantaneous methods to serve the existing purpose, for example, traditional telephone, e-mail, face book, twitter, and so on

Secondary data
Due to availability of information on the external environment in China, the researcher had the opportunity to use those sources to organise the paper. Cohen, Manion & Morrison (2007), and Zikmund (2006) pointed out that secondary data is the processed data for performing present research. Malhotra (2009) and Saunders, Thornhill & Lewis (2006) stated that secondary sources are the published works of prominent writers and researcher, such as, magazines, books, journals articles and former research works. They further added that these data are easily accessible, inexpensive, and promptly obtainable for the purpose. In addition, this type of information is the base of exploratory research approach.

On the other hand, the effect of external environment of China on foreign beverage companies is the unique topic for research. In this context, the outcomes of existing research would enhance to identify research problems and possible solutions. However, the author of this study would use Mintel reports, the annual report 2009 of Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola, related research papers on external environment of China, several journal articles, other internet resources, books, past survey reports, and so on.

Questionnaire Design
Questionnaire is one of the most significant portions of the quantitative research as it helps to gather primary data (Sekaran, 2006). Malhotra (2009) stated that questionnaire designing is an art not science, so the researcher has the opportunity to give highest effort on this aspect to prepare questionnaire in his own way. Malthotra also addressed that broad discussion with selected respondents might bring unreasonable outcomes with different inspection and attitude while specific questionnaire assist the interviewees to consider with a particular research problem.

In this case, the researcher specially concentrates on designing a questionnaire as recommendations, conclusion, and the findings chapter of this dissertation would develop from the response of the target respondents.

Data Analysis process
At this point, the author of this paper would edit all the information to eliminate the irreconcilable and untrue data about the external environment in China and its effect on foreign beverage companies. However, it is essential to mention that the writer would verify primary data in view of secondary data sources connected with the case study of Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola in China. To formulate the paper, the researcher would compare and contrast the primary and secondary data concerning the impact the external environment in China by presenting graphical charts and using other explanatory research approach.

Limitation of Data Collection Procedure
The main problem of the data collection process was limited time as the researcher had decided to gather primary data from 40 respondents, which was difficult task to perform within short deadline. In addition, lack of secondary data, unreliable documents, inappropriate information, and cost of the academic reports were the key trouble to collect information to complete the paper.

Data Analysis and Results
The fundamental issue of data analysis chapter is to discuss the results of the real survey to estimate and evaluate the external environment in China and its effect on foreign beverage companies.

Name of respondents
The aim of the researcher to ask this general question was to introduce with the respondents of the survey.

Integration with the PepsiCo and Coca Cola
Survey report demonstrates that among the respondents, the number of Midlevel Management of PepsiCo was 10, Midlevel Management of Coca-Cola was 10, Owner of Franchise or Retail outlets were 10, and Academia and Social Groups were 10.

Grouping respondents by gender
Among 40 respondents, 24 respondents (60% of interviewees) were male and 16 respondents were female.
